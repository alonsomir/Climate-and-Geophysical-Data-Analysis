# # The *z*-Statistic
# 
# Rather than referring to diagrams of the standard normal distribution to assess probabilities of $z$, the typical thing to do in statistics courses is to use $z$-tables.
# 
# We will take a look at how to use tables, but we will also use python functions.
# 
# The following [link]() contains a $z$-table (as well as other tables), and it is also shown in [Figure 7](ztab).
# 
# ```{figure} ztab.png

# *z*-Table. Table entries for $z$ represent the area under the curve to the left of $z$. Only positive values for $z$ are shown. (from C. Dougherty Introduction to Econometrics second edition 2002, Oxford University Press, Oxford.)
# ```
# 
# Let's learn how to read this table using a few examples.
# 
# ## *z*-Statistic Examples
# 
# Assume the you have 50 years of monthly El-Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices ($Z$), and that the index is well approximated by a standard normal distribution:
# 
# ```{admonition} Question #1
# :class: tip
# 1. Using the table, what is the probability that a randomly chosen month has an ENSO index of exactly +2?
# ```
# 
# Before you go to the table, re-read this question. What are the chances that a continuous variable, like the ENSO index, has a value of *exactly* +2? This is a trick question. In this case, the probability is zero. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Question #2
# :class: tip
# 2. Using the table, what is the probability that a randomly chosen month has an ENSO index of +2.05 or less?
# ```
# 
# Looking at the $z$-table in [Figure 7](ztab), we go to the left-most column and look for a value of 2.0. We can use the other columns to add the appropriate hundreths to our value of 2.0. We want to add 0.05 to get 2.05, so we look-up the probability under the column labelled 0.05. What do you get?
# 
# You should get a value of 0.9798. This means that there is a 97.98% probability that a randomly chosen month has an ENSO index or +2.05 or less.
# 
# Let's try another one.
# 
# ```{admonition} Question #3
# :class: tip
# 3. Using the table, what is the probability that a randomly chosen month has an ENSO index of +2.05 or greater?
# ```
# 
# This one is a bit trickier. The $z$-table we are using shows us the area under the curve left of $z$, but we actually want to know the area right of $z$. The key is that we know the total area under this curve is 1. So, the probability that a randomly chosen month has an ENSO index or +2.05 or greater is simply 1 - 0.9798 = 0.0202.
# 
# Now, let's try these same two examples with python.

# In[1]:


# To look up this the probability of a certain z-score in python, we use the scipy.stats norm.cdf() function
import scipy.stats as st

#Example #2
p = st.norm.cdf(2.05)
print(round(p,4)) # here, I'm rounding to the same number of decimal places as the table.


# We should get the same answer that we got with the table, and we do.

# In[2]:


#Example #3
p = 1- st.norm.cdf(2.05)
print(round(p,4))


# Great! Everything checks out.

# Here are a few more for you to try with the table first and then check with python.
# 
# ```{admonition} Question #4
# :class: tip
# 4. What is the probability the ENSO index is 1.23 or smaller?
# ```

# In[3]:


#Example #4
p = st.norm.cdf(1.23)
print(round(p,4))


# ```{admonition} Question #5
# :class: tip
# 5. What is the probability the ENSO index is 1.23 or greater?
# ```

# In[4]:


#Example #5
p = 1-st.norm.cdf(1.23)
print(round(p,4))


# ```{admonition} Question #6
# :class: tip
# 6. What is the probability the ENSO index is greater than +1 and less than +2?
# ```

# In[5]:


#Example #6
p = st.norm.cdf(2) - st.norm.cdf(1)
print(round(p,4))


# We can also use the $z$-table in reverse, i.e., if we know the probability of an event, we can find the $z$-score. Using the same ENSO index as above:
# 
# ```{admonition} Question #7
# :class: tip
# 7. What ENSO index $\epsilon$ gives $Pr$($z$ $\leq$ $\epsilon$) = 0.9? 
# ```
# 
# The formulation of this problem corresponds to the structure of our $z$-table which shows the area under the curve to the left ($\leq$) of $z$. Looking at the table, we look for the value 0.9. We don't see an exact value for 0.9, but we can interpolate. $\epsilon$ in about 1.282.
# 
# Let's check this with python.

# In[6]:


# To look up this the z-score for a certain probability in python, we use the scipy.stats norm.ppf() function

# Example #7
z = st.norm.ppf(0.9)
print(round(z,3))


# Now, you can try the rest on your own. Open up a blank notebook to try it out before you check the answer.

# ```{admonition} Question #8
# :class: tip
# 8. What ENSO index $\epsilon$ gives $Pr$($z$ $\geq$ $\epsilon$) = 0.1? 
# ```

# In[7]:


# Example #2
z = -st.norm.ppf(0.1)
print(round(z,3))


# ```{admonition} Question #9
# :class: tip
# 9. What ENSO index $\epsilon$ gives $Pr$($z$ $\leq$ $\epsilon$) = 0.1?
# ```

# In[8]:


# Example #3
z = st.norm.ppf(0.1)
print(round(z,3))


# ```{admonition} Question #10
# :class: tip
# 10. What ENSO index $\epsilon$ gives $Pr$(|$z$| $\geq$ $\epsilon$) = 0.1? (Note: |$z$| $\geq$ $\epsilon$ is the same as $z$ $\leq$ -$\epsilon$ and $z$ $\geq$ $\epsilon$)
# ```

# In[9]:


# Example #3
z1 = st.norm.ppf(0.05)
z2 = st.norm.ppf(0.95)
print(round(z1,3),round(z2,3))
