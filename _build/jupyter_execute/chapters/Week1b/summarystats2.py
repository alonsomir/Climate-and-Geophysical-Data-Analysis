# # Summary Statistics: Part II
# 
# ## 3. Higher Moments
# 
# In general, all statistical moments are defined as:
# 
# $$  
# \overline{x^{\prime r}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \overline{x})^r
# $$
# 
# where $r$ denotes the moment (e.g. $r$ = 2 is the variance)
# 
# The third and fourth moments are known as the **skewness** and **kurtosis** and these describe the shape of a distribution. In practice, these sample moments are typically reported in their *standardized* form as follows:
# 
# $$
# \alpha_r = \frac{\overline{x^{\prime r}}}{s^r}
# $$
# 
# where $s$ is the sample standard deviation.
# 
# ### 3.1 Skewness
# 
# The **skewness** indicates the degree of asymmetry of the distribution about the mean. $\alpha_3$ > 0 indicates that the distribution has a long tail on the positive side of the mean and $\alpha$ < 0 indicates a long tail on the negative side of the mean. Note a normal distribution has $\alpha$ = 0 (we will discuss the normal distribution in the next section).
# 
# ### 3.2 Kurtosis
# 
# The **kurtosis** describes the shape of a distributionâ€™s tails relative to the rest of the distribution. A normal distribution has $\alpha_4$ = 3. $\alpha_4$ > 3 indicates a more peaked distribution compared to normal (*leptokurtic*) and $\alpha_4$ < 3 indicates a flatter distribution (*platykurtic*).
